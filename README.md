# blind-auction-app
a simple blind auction app, the idea is that each person participating is not aware of the other person bid.
to start you choose the object to be auctioned, and the price, the bid for the object cannot be lower then the min asking price.
To end the auction you put the password: 123456 on the name field and click end auction.
if there is a tie for the highest bid, another round will be created, this time with the minimun price being the highest price from the previous round.
The winner will be displayed on the screen for a second, after that the winner for each item will be stored in the 'local storage' in the browser,
you can also check the console during the auction to see all the bidders and their bids
